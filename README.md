# Python_Spark_Collaborative_filtering_systems
As part of my second-year internship, I chose to apply my statistical and econometric knowledge in the digital marketing sector. For such needs, I joined the Data Science team of the programmatic platform Tradelab, a French expert of Real Time Bidding, during the summer 2017.

The period I worked there was not anodyne. Tradelab developped its portfolio of clients in the agri-food sector, and seeked to exploit the data it collects which could be an asset for the signing of contracts, and it constituted my mission.
I consider to have benefited from three main advantages for its smooth progress.
The first is access to data, as the company can exclusively access information from users of the flagship sites of the company Webedia (Allocine.com, JeuxVideo.com, 750gr.com).
The second advantage was the technical framework through the available infrastructure, indeed we have the ability to configure clusters via the Google Cloud platform. Depending on the amount of data used and the complexity of the calculations performed, we use clusters composed of more or fewer virtual machines and whose machines have more or less Random-Access Memory (RAM).
Finally, the quality of the Data Science team’s profiles and the widespread enthusiasm contributed to the evolution of my work under ideal conditions.

My assignments were centered around the 750g.com website, which offers more than 100,000 cooking recipes and attracts more than 5 million unique visitors per month. In order to catch the interest of a strong player in the agri-food industry, a good knowledge of the users of its products is essential. Thus, my work was to target the individuals who might be tempted by the products of the potentially future customer, through two major axes of analysis.
The first was to deduce sub-representations or over-representations of certain categories of recipes judiciously chosen, among the consumers of the products we deal with. In order to identify the signifi- cant results, we conducted statistical tests. The benefit of the analysis results is to target individuals who may be interested in the products considered.
The second was more consequent, it consisted of setting up different systems of recommendations, from users to cooking recipes. Using different mathematical representations for users’ culinary profiles, and two similarity indices, I could link users according to their culinary tastes. For a given individual, we can thus obtain recipes recommendations according to those consulted by the users considered to be the closest to him.
￼Using similar mathematical representations for the different recipes, we are able to link users and recipes, and in this way recommend recipes to a given individual.
We compared the systems of recommendations, conducting cross validations and choosing an ade- quate performance score.
The benefits of the systems of recommendation are twofold.
First of all, it allows to send advertising banners to an individual, via the buying patterns and appetence for certain products of the individuals closed to him.
Second of all, from the recipes recommended to an individual, we can spread banners according to the interests of the users who have consulted these recipes, by attracting more attention using the image of one recipe added to the banner.
I am experiencing some regret as I did not have time to implement the methods I conceived for advertising campaigns of agri-food customers. These should be useful in the coming months.

In conclusion, this experience was positive from every point of view. Firstly, I had the opportunity to do statistical learning and conduct statistical tests related to predictive marketing. Secondly, I improved my programming skills while discovering the Apache Spark infrastructure where I was able to run Python scripts. Finally, I have benefited from an ideal environment, a young and dynamic company where collaboration is paramount.
